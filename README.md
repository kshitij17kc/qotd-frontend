# QOTD – Question of the Day (Frontend)

This project is a single-page frontend experience for a **Question of the Day (QOTD)** feature designed for an edtech platform like TechLearn Solutions.

The goal is to encourage students to solve **one coding problem daily** through a clean, familiar, and motivating interface.

---

##  Tech Stack Used

- HTML5 (semantic structure)
- CSS3 (Flexbox, CSS variables, responsive design)
- Vanilla JavaScript (UI interactivity)
- Deployed using Netlify

No external frameworks were used to focus on frontend fundamentals.

---

##  Layout & Design Decisions

- **LeetCode-inspired layout** to reduce learning friction and make the interface instantly familiar
- **Blue gradient header** for branding and strong visual hierarchy
- **Split layout**:
  - Left: Problem statement (reading & understanding)
  - Center: Code editor (primary focus)
  - Right: Stats & hints (secondary context)
- White cards on muted background for readability
- Editor styled like an IDE to improve immersion

---

##  Encouraging Daily Student Engagement

The design promotes daily usage through:
- Visible streak indicator
- Clear primary CTA (Run / Submit)
- Hint hidden by default to encourage thinking
- Familiar workflow that minimizes effort
- Immediate feedback on submission

These elements help build consistency and habit formation.

## What I Would Improve With More Time

- Real code execution via backend sandbox
- User authentication and saved progress
- Daily streak tracking across sessions
- Dark mode toggle
- Accessibility improvements (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
